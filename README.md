## Summary Description

"Black Sails" is a loosely historical, action-adventure television series set in the Caribbean (and some scenes in England) a few decades before the U.S. fought for independence from Great Britain. It features a mix of fictional pirates from the novel "Treasure Island" and real life historical figures. The show serves as an adult-level (nudity, violence, gore) prequel to "Treasure Island" and tells a complete story of richly complicated characters (especially Captain Flint and Long John Silver) across four television seasons.

There were several reasons behind my chosing it as the subject of my fansite app. Firstly there do not appear to be very many existing fansites for the show. I could only find one, and it was only a wikipages fansite without any other features. The timing for a new fansite of "Black Sails" is especially relevant now because Netflix only just added the show to their streaming platform last year. The show features movie-quality costumes/sets, stars a number of award-winning actors, received favorable reviews from both critics and audiences, and won awards for both visual effects and music/sound editing.  The classic children's book ("Treasure Island") inspiring the show remains popular and well-known.  Fictitious representations of pirates also remain popular among adult hobbiests. Despite these factors, widespread popular knowledge about the tv show remains relatively weak, possibly due to it having originally aired during the height of "Game of Thrones" popularity (ie. network competition for viewers may have hindered widespread public viewing of "Black Sails").  Lastly, factual knowledge about American and Caribbean history remains a public need and is sought out by various history hobbyists and educators.

My app utilizes APIs to provide all of the standard tv show fansite details such as episode summaries, ratings, a cast listing, and summary descriptions of each character. To help fulfill the added goal of learning more, when appropriate (ie. when the character wasn't invented specifically for the show) I also provided information concerning the historical or literary figure.

To further expand on fulfilling that expressed desire audiences have for learning more about the real life history behind the show, my app allows visitors to read the archived pages of antique books about piracy that have been saved within the Library of Congress.

When asked to elaborate on what they wished was available on more fansites, some television aficionados also specified that they wished to learn more about the mindset/intentions of producers, script writers, and actors in their favorite shows. To fulfill that goal for fans of "Black Sails," my app provides easy access to listen to interviews of the cast and crew that were conducted on the "Fathoms Deep" podcast.
